# Upcoming Workshops

## Anomaly Detection Overview w/ Dr. Veronika Strnadova-Neeley

### Monday, April 19th at 5PM ([Zoom Link](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZwrdemtqDsvG9WMAxjs-izv6TE-MR4vZLla))

> Anomaly detection is the vaguely defined task of “finding patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior,” with broad applicability in many diverse domains. For example, anomaly detection can be used to identify fraud in credit card transactions, malicious network traffic, faults in safety-critical systems, and tumors in MRI scans, among other out-of-the-ordinary patterns in a variety of data sources. Given the broad range of applications for anomaly detection, and the differing data formats and sources, how exactly might we define what constitutes anomalous behavior in a data set in a general and useful way? To answer this question, we will explore the methodology employed by several popular anomaly detection algorithms, such as Local Outlier Factor and Isolation Forest. We will also work through some simple examples that demonstrate how to apply these methods to small real-world data sets in the Python programming language, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages.
