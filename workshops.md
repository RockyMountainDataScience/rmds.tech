## Anomaly Detection Overview w/ 
### Dr. Veronika Strnadova-Neeley
#### Monday, April 19th

 > Anomaly detection is the vaguely defined task of “finding patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior,” with broad applicability in many diverse domains. For example, anomaly detection can be used to identify fraud in credit card transactions, malicious network traffic, faults in safety-critical systems, and tumors in MRI scans, among other out-of-the-ordinary patterns in a variety of data sources. Given the broad range of applications for anomaly detection, and the differing data formats and sources, how exactly might we define what constitutes anomalous behavior in a data set in a general and useful way? To answer this question, we will explore the methodology employed by several popular anomaly detection algorithms, such as Local Outlier Factor and Isolation Forest. We will also work through some simple examples that demonstrate how to apply these methods to small real-world data sets in the Python programming language, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages.

## Visualizing High Dimensional Data with t-SNE and Autoencoders
### Joe Bretz
#### Monday, March 22, 2021

> Autoencoder and t-SNE methods are used to extract features/structure from high dimensional data but in very different ways. In this workshop, we apply both methods to a dataset for dimensionality reduction and visualization, highlighting the utility, limitations, and differences of the two.

## Introduction to Probablistic Programming
### Jordan Love
#### Monday, March 8, 2021

> Probabilistic Programming is a technique which enables complex machine learning and statistical models to be written in a concise way using specifically designed Probabilistic Programming Languages. In this workshop, we work with an applied example of how to develop a model in Stan from start to finish in a fraction of the time. We will spend time briefly discussing bayesian inference, hierarchical models, and the challenges of using probabilistic programming languages.

## Conversational SQL
### Jordan Love
#### Monday, February 8, 2021

> AThis workshop will focus on the practical tools for interacting with relational databases as a data scientist including navigating multiple tables and understanding the structure of databases. Our workshop will have several exercises for attendees to optionally participate in to get a hands-on experience with a SQL database.

## Data Scientist Panel
### Dr. Kathryn Irvine, Dr. Danielle Ciesielski, Dr. Kenny Flagg, Wyatt Madden
#### Monday, February 1, 2021

> At least once each academic year, we try to get a panel of data scientists in the field so we can come together and ask them the same questions side by side to learn about how the field differs across positions and organizations. We get a chance to do that this semester, next Monday at 5 PM. Our invited panelists range from Research Statisticians to Software Engineers. While we come prepared with questions to kick-start the conversation, we encourage you to bring your own!

## Become a Data Scientist with these 3 models!
### Atrium Team (Kenny Flagg, Paul Harmon)
#### Monday, January 25, 2021

> "Data Science" means many things to many different organizations, and the gulf between academic and commercial Data Science is especially large. Data Scientists in industry and business often create lots of value using relative simple methods. We will introduce you to our toolbox of go-to models (you are probably already familiar with them!) and present some use-cases where these models solved very complicated problems for our clients. Then, we will discuss our experiences learning the lingo of the Agile software development methodologies popular in commercial IT organizations. This will give you a taste of what it is like to translate your university Data Science experience to the world of enterprise consulting.

## Compartmental Models
### Wyatt Madden and Will Rogers
#### Monday, November 9, 2020

> Compartmental models are a classic approach to modeling the spread of infectious disease using differential equations. Recent advances in probabilistic treatment of these models will be discussed and a case study on COVID-19 spread across campus is presented. Will Rogers will be joining Wyatt to present the case study.

## Forecasting Time Series
### Jordan Love
#### Monday, October 26, 2020

> Jordan Love will present a workshop introducing three possible modeling choices when tasked with Forecasting Time Series. The workshop will focus on Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA Modeling, and Dynamic Linear Models. We will discuss the connection between Hidden Markov Models and Dynamic Linear Models as both being within the class of flexible and powerful State Space Models. Finally, we will demonstrate each model using COVID-19 Case Count data for Gallatin County.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent
### Jacob Munson
#### Monday, October 12, 2020

> This algorithm is arguably the most commonly used optimization algorithm for data science applications big and small. Discussion of the algorithm in detail will be presented with a sample application of the algorithm to estimate a parameter. In addition, we will highlight common pitfalls in hyperparameter tuning often encountered in the use of this algorithm.

## Principal Component Analysis on Image Data
### Catherine Potts
#### Monday, September 14, 2020

> Principal component analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised machine learning model that is extremely popular with the scientific community. But not every paper using PCA explains what it is and how it works. In this week's workshop we'll be using PCA to extract features from the MNIST written digits image database. Along the way we'll talk about PCA as a dimensionality reduction tool, the math behind the model, interpreting the principal components, and some real world PCA applications. If you've heard of PCA but aren't quite sure what goes into it, or what comes out of it, this workshop is for you!

## Machine Learning Fundamentals I
### RMDS Team (Jordan Love, Catherine Potts, Jacob Munson, Jordan Schupbach)
#### Monday, August 24, 2020

> Our first workshop, Introduction to Machine Learning I, will be focused less on the theoretical underpinnings of ML and more on the practical techniques of managing data science projects in general. We will discuss common types of problems and data you may encounter and offer a framework for thinking these projects.

## Going Fast in R: An Introduction to doParallel, Rcpp, and JuliaCall
### Jordan Love
#### Monday, April 27, 2020

> Depending on the model or computation you're working, time may not be on your side. In this workshop we talk about strategies to speed up code to make things go faster in R. We focus on two strategies for providing a speed boost to your code: parallelization and alternative languages. We use existing packages in R to exploit problem structure in order to make computations simultaneous instead of sequential. If parallelization is not an option or is not enough, using alternative languages which can be called from R may provide relief. We focus on using C++ using the well-developed Rcpp package and provide an introduction to a relatively new contender, Julia, while demonstrating how each can be used in R.

## Exoplanet Hunting in Deep Space (Part II)
### Mike Shumko
#### Monday, April 13, 2020

> In this two-part workshop we will look at the light intensity time  series from the Kepler satellite to look for exoplanets around other  stars. The first workshop will focus on understanding and cleaning the  data and in the second workshop we will apply a ML model to classify each star as having or not having a planet.
